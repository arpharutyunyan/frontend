        Project status can be tracked via the core team discussion forum.
        However, major changes to React go through the Future of React repository issues
        and pull requests. This enables the React community to provide feedback on new
        potential features, experimental APIs and JavaScript syntax improvements.
    </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released
        an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML
        component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011
        and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.
        React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React,
        was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March
        2015.
    </p>
    <p>
        On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms
        for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack. React Fiber
        was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of
        the React library. The actual syntax for programming with React does not change;
        only the way that the syntax is executed has changed. React's old rendering system,
        Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on dynamic change was
        not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to
        accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that
        can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be
        broken into segments that may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript
        functions and virtual DOM objects are called "fibers", and each can be operated
        and updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.
    </p>
    <p>On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.</p>
    <p>
        On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public. The release
        introduced React Hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
        On August 10, 2020, the React team announced the first release candidate for
        React v17.0, notable as the first major release without major changes to the React
        developer-facing API.
    </p>
    <p>
        On March 29, 2022, React 18 was released which introduced a new concurrent renderer,
        automatic batching and support for server side rendering with Suspense.
